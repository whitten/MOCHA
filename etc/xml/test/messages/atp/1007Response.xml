                        <mechanismOfAction>MECHANISM OF ACTION:  Inhibition of warfarin hepatic metabolism. The effect appears to be greater on the less active R-warfarin than on the S-warfarin.</mechanismOfAction>
                        <clinicalEffects>CLINICAL EFFECTS:  The pharmacologic effects of warfarin may be increased resulting in severe bleeding.</clinicalEffects>

                        <patientManagement>PATIENT MANAGEMENT:  Coadministration of cimetidine and warfarin should be avoided. If they are administered concurrently, monitor anticoagulant activity and adjust the dose of warfarin indicated. The H-2 antagonists famotidine and nizatidine are unlikely to interact with warfarin.The time of highest risk for a coumarin-type drug interaction is when the precipitant drug is initiated or discontinued. Contact the prescriber before initiating, altering the dose or discontinuing either drug.</patientManagement>
                        <discussion>DISCUSSION:  The majority of drug interaction reports involving H-2 antagonists and warfarin have occurred with cimetidine. Reports of a possibly significant interaction between ranitidine and warfarin have been equivocal. Famotidine and nizatidine do not appear to affect prothrombin time.</discussion>

                        <severityLevel>SEVERITY LEVEL:  2-Severe Interaction: Action is required to reduce the risk of severe adverse interaction.</severityLevel>
                        <mechanismOfAction>MECHANISM OF ACTION:  Amiodarone has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of the R- and S-enantiomers of warfarin by CYP P-450 in vitro and in vivo.(1-4) Amiodarone may also inhibit the metabolism of acenocoumarol(5) and other anticoagulants.</mechanismOfAction>
                        <clinicalEffects>CLINICAL EFFECTS:  The concurrent administration of amiodarone and an anticoagulant may result in an increase in the clinical effects of the anticoagulant and an increased risk of bleeding.(1-22)  It may take several weeks of concurrent therapy before the full effects of this interaction are noted.  The effect of amiodarone on anticoagulant levels may continue for several months after amiodarone is discontinued.</clinicalEffects>
                        <predisposingFactors>PREDISPOSING FACTORS:  Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis may increase the metabolic clearance of some vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, decreasing anticoagulant requirements.(6)</predisposingFactors>
                        <patientManagement>PATIENT MANAGEMENT:  If both drugs are administered concurrently, adjust the anticoagulant dose as needed based on carefully monitored prothrombin activity.  The US manufacturer of amiodarone recommends decreasing the anticoagulant dose by 1/3 to 1/2, followed by close monitoring of prothrombin activity.(22)</patientManagement>
                        <discussion>DISCUSSION:  Several studies and case reports have documented the potential interaction between warfarin and amiodarone.  In several studies, the dosage of warfarin had to be decreased between 32.9% and 70% to maintain satisfactory prothrombin activity.(1-4,6-11)Several case reports and retrospective chart reviews have also documented the potential interaction between amiodarone and acenocoumarol.  The dosage reduction of acenocoumarol required to maintain satisfactory prothrombin activity ranged from 20% to 60%.(12-18)A case report describes a 66-year-old male with a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation.  While taking both amiodarone and a low-dose warfarin therapy, prothrombin times were prolonged, INR values were increased and bleeding occurred.  Both drugs were withheld, and the effect of the interaction continued for an extended period of time.(19)One study evaluated the role desethylamiodarone, the active metabolite of amiodarone, played on concurrent warfarin therapy.  After analyzing 25 patients with structural heart disease and arrhythmias, it was found that the concentration of desethylamiodarone played a larger role in augmenting the INR, than the concentration of amiodarone alone.  Additional examination revealed that amiodarone primarily inhibits CYP P-450-1A2 and CYP P-450-3A4, whereas desethylamiodarone primarily inhibits CYP P-450-2C9, the isozyme responsible for the metabolism of S-warfarin.(20)An observational, cohort study reviewed the interaction of amiodarone with warfarin for a period of at least one year, while evaluating the adjustments needed to achieve an INR ratio between 2 and 3.  After analyzing 43 patients, baseline warfarin therapy required a mean 44% reduction in dose after seven weeks of coadministration with amiodarone.  Five subjects experienced minor bleeding.  For patients receiving amiodarone maintenance, warfarin dose reductions were as follows: 400 mg/d, reduce warfarin dose 40%; 300 mg/d, reduce warfarin dose 35%; 200/d, reduce warfarin dose 30%; and 100 mg/d, reduce warfarin dose by 25%.  All warfarin dose reductions are approximations and must be based on aggressive INR monitoring.(21)</discussion>

                        <patientManagement>PATIENT MANAGEMENT:  If both drugs are administered, adjust the quinidine dose as needed based on serum quinidine levels, cardiac function, and patient response. Since other H-2 antagonists (e.g., ranitidine, famotidine) do not appear to interact, substituting cimetidine with one of these agents may be desirable. Ventricular arrhythmia has been reported during concurrent use of ranitidine and quinidine. However, if a patient is already receiving this combination and is not experiencing adverse effects, substitution is probably not necessary.</patientManagement>
                        <discussion>DISCUSSION:  The onset and reversal of the interaction may occur within 48 hours of starting or stopping cimetidine in a patient receiving quinidine. Signs and symptoms of quinidine toxicity include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, headache, tinnitus, vertigo and confusion. Electrocardiogram changes, including prolongation of the QT and QRS intervals may also occur.</discussion>

                        <mechanismOfAction>MECHANISM OF ACTION:  The exact mechanism is unknown.  Amiodarone may decrease quinidine tissue binding(1,2) or may decrease renal or hepatic clearance of quinidine.(2)  Concurrent use may result in additive or synergistic effects on the QT interval.(3)</mechanismOfAction>
                        <clinicalEffects>CLINICAL EFFECTS:  May see an increase in the pharmacologic effects of quinidine due to elevated serum levels.  The QTc interval may be prolonged and result in life-threatening arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes.</clinicalEffects>
                        <predisposingFactors>PREDISPOSING FACTORS:  Other group Ia antiarrhythmics.</predisposingFactors>
                        <patientManagement>PATIENT MANAGEMENT:  The Australian manufacturer of amiodarone states that concurrent use of agents known to cause torsades de pointes, such as quinidine, is contraindicated.(3)The US manufacturer of amiodarone states that the need to co-administer amiodarone with any other drug known to prolong the QTc interval must be based on a careful assessment of the potential risks and benefits of doing so for each patient.(4)If concurrent therapy is warranted, patients should be monitored for increased quinidine levels and signs of quinidine toxicity.  Cardiac function should also be monitored.  The dosage of quinidine may need to be adjusted.  The US manufacturer of amiodarone recommends that the dosage of quinidine be reduced by one-third during concurrent amiodarone.(4)  One study recommends that the dosage of quinidine be reduced by 30-50% when amiodarone is added to therapy.(2)</patientManagement>
                        <discussion>DISCUSSION:  In patients receiving concurrent amiodarone and quinidine, elevated serum levels and prolonged QT interval have been reported.(1,5-9) In a study in 11 patients, the addition of amiodarone to quinidine therapy resulted in an increase in quinidine levels by 32% and quinidine toxicity in seven patients.  The increase in quinidine levels was seen as early as 24 hours after the addition of amiodarone.(2)</discussion>

                        <discussion>DISCUSSION:  Indinavir has been shown to inhibit CYP P-450-3A4.  Therefore, the manufacturer of indinavir states that the concurrent administration of indinavir with amiodarone, which is metabolized by CYP P-450-3A4, is contraindicated.(1)Nelfinavir has been shown to inhibit CYP P-450-3A4.  Therefore, the manufacturer of nelfinavir states that the concurrent administration of nelfinavir with amiodarone, which is metabolized by CYP P-450-3A4, is contraindicated.(2)Ritonavir has also been shown to inhibit CYP P-450-3A4. Therefore, the manufacturer of ritonavir state that the concurrent administration of ritonavir with amiodarone is contraindicated.(3)</discussion>

                        <mechanismOfAction>MECHANISM OF ACTION:  Acetaminophen may reduce levels of functional Factor VI, thereby increasing the International Normalized Ratio (INR).(1)</mechanismOfAction>
                        <clinicalEffects>CLINICAL EFFECTS:  Concurrent use of routine acetaminophen, especially at dosages greater than 3 grams/day, and coumarin anticoagulants may result in elevated anticoagulant effects.</clinicalEffects>
                        <predisposingFactors>PREDISPOSING FACTORS:  Routine use of acetaminophen at dosages greater than 3 grams/day may increase the risk of the interaction.</predisposingFactors>
                        <patientManagement>PATIENT MANAGEMENT:  Patients receiving routine acetaminophen at dosages greater than 3 grams/day with coumarin anticoagulants should be closely monitored for changes in anticoagulant effects.  The dosage of the anticoagulant may need to be adjusted.Patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants should be counseled on the use of acetaminophen.</patientManagement>
                        <discussion>DISCUSSION:  In a study in 11 patients maintained on warfarin, use of acetaminophen (4 grams daily for 14 days) increased INR values by an average of 1.04.(2)In a study in 36 patients maintained on warfarin, the addition of acetaminophen (2 grams/day or 4 grams/day) increased INR values.(3)In a study in 20 patients maintained on warfarin, the addition of acetaminophen (4 grams/day for 14 days) increased average INR values by 1.20 (from 2.6 to 3.45).(4)In a study, 12 patients maintained on various anticoagulants (anisindione, dicoumarol, phenprocoumon, and warfarin) who received 4 weeks of acetaminophen (2.6 grams/day) were compared to 50 subjects maintained on various anticoagulants who did not receive acetaminophen.  By the third week of concurrent acetaminophen, prothrombin times increased from 23 seconds to 28.4 seconds.  The average warfarin-equivalent dose decreased by 5.8 mg to 4.4 mg.  In another phase, 50 subjects maintained on various anticoagulants received acetaminophen (2.6 grams/day for 14 days).  The mean prothrombin increase was 3.6 seconds.(5)There have been case reports of increased INRs following concurrent acetaminophen in patients maintained on warfarin(6-9) and acenocoumarol.(10)In contrast to the above reports, other studies have found no effects on acenocoumarol,(11) phenprocoumon,(11-13) or warfarin(14,15) by acetaminophen.</discussion>
